# BonziWORLD 2: Replica
Some literal bloated replica of BonziWORLD 2.

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run a fork of my replica BonziWORLD 2, by all means go ahead.
Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.
